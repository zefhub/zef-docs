## Config file

The Zef configuration file is used for controlling the behaviour of the
low-level interactions of Zef with your filesystem and ZefHub.

### Location

The file is located at `SESSION_PATH/config.yaml` where `SESSION_PATH` is either:

- under Linux/MacOS: `~/.zef`
- under Windows: `%APP_DATA%/.zef`

This can be overridden with the `ZEFDB_SESSION_PATH` environment variable.

### Modifying

The file itself is a YAML file and can be edited in any text editor. Inside of a
python shell, you can also read and set variables with the `config` zefop:

```py
"login.autoConnect" | config[KW.get] | collect
("login.autoConnect"
```

Note that getting a variable will search in the following order:

1. Values that have been set in the current session
2. The corresponding environment variable (see below)
3. The config.yaml file
4. The default value for the variable

### Variable listing

It is possible to obtain a listing of all variables and their currently set
values by running:

```py
"login" | config[KW.list] | collect
```

The string passed into `config[KW.list]` is a filter string. Pass `""` if you
would like the entire config.
