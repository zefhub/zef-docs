Zef is a comprehensive data-oriented library that unifies databases and real-time streaming data and managed effects to simplify building modern  real-time reactive web applications directly from within Python.  
  
  
  
#### Is Zef a Library or a Framework?  
You can use it as either one.  
- Individual parts of Zef are incrementally adoptable as a library: import a part locally and start using it  
- You can build end-to-end reactive applications using Zef as a framework (ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§). Read more about how Zef allows you to use Python for distributed computation, similar to Elixir.
