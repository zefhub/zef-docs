title: Share Graphs

When you create a graph via `Graph(True)` it is automatically synced to ZefHub.
A local-only graph can also be synced via `g | sync | run`.

Synced graphs can be shared with other users.

## Sharing graphs

To give other users access to your graph, you can run:

```python
"joe.bloggs@gmail.com" | grant[KW.view][g] | run
```

The user `joe.bloggs@gmail.com` can then see your graph by its UID, i.e. they
can then run:

```python
g = Graph("<uid here>")
```

where the uid can be discovered by running `uid(g)`.

Privileges that are allowed are:
- `KW.view`: viewing (subscribing to) the graph contents.
- `KW.host`: taking the host role of a graph.
- `KW.append`: appending to the graph. This could be done by taking the host
  role or by sending merge requests.
- `KW.discover`: seeing the graph's tags in `zearch` queries.
- `KW.modify_rights`: changing the privileges of the graph.

To make a graph publically available, you can use:

```python
"group:everyone" | grant[KW.view][g] | run
```

## Tagging graphs

As sharing UIDs is tedious, you can also tag your graphs:

```python
g | tag["secret-santa-planning"] | run
```

You and other users with viewing rights can then access this graph via `Graph("<your-user-name>/secret-santa-planning")`.

Unless specified, your tags will be grouped into your user namespace. If you
want to override this, you can provide a qualified name with extra `/`
divisions:

```python
g | tag["ACME-company/secret-santa-planning"] | run
```

## Revoking access privileges

The `revoke` zefop is the opposite of `grant`:

```python
"joe.bloggs@gmail.com" | revoke[KW.view][g] | run
```

## Appending to a shared graph

If you have subscribed to a graph that you have append-privileges, then you can
directly add new facts to the graph:

```python
g = Graph("secret-santa-planning")

(ET.Participant, RT.Name, "Krampus") | g | run
```

This will cause a "merge request" to be sent via the network and wait for a
successful response to be received.

If many rapid updates need to be applied, you should take the transactor role:

```python
g | take_transactor_role | run
for i in range(1000):
    ET.Participant | g | run
g | release_transactor_role | run
```

Acquiring host role means that all updates are performed in-memory with maximum
speed. These updates are synchronized with ZefHub in a background process. Note
that only one python process can have host role at any one time.

## Future plans

In the future, graph tags will be made available via projects. So expect to
see something similar to:

```python
g = Graph()
g | sync["project-name"] | run
g | tag["specific-graph"] | run

g2 = Graph("project-name", "specific-graph")

g == g2
```
