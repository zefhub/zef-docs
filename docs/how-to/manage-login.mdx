title: Manage ZefHub Authentication

import RequiredVersion from "@theme/RequiredVersion";

## Logging in for the first time

After starting a python session, you can run:

```python
from zef import *
from zef.ops import *

login | run
```

This will open a browser to select how you would prefer to authenticate to
ZefHub. There are several methods:

- "Email": this is to use a given email address and password.
- "GitHub": use O-Auth to create a ZefHub account that is linked with your
  GitHub account.
- "Guest": don't create any account, but login as a guest user for this session only.

Login information for Zef is stored in `~/.zef/hub.zefhub.io/credentials` for future sessions.
No passwords are stored in this, only a refresh token.

## Logging out

After starting a python session, you can run:

```python
from zef import *
from zef.ops import *

logout | run
```

This is nearly equivalent to deleting the `~/.zef/hub.zefhub.io/credentials`
file but will also forcibly unload any graphs you have loaded.

:::danger

When graphs are unloaded, any `ZefRef` referencing that graph is invalidated.
**Accessing an invalid `ZefRef` will cause a segmentation fault**.

## Overriding the user account for a session

User accounts can be overridden with an environment variable or a plain text
file. See the page [configuration](/configuration-connections) for more details.
